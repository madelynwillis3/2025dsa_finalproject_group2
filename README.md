Repository for group 2's Data Science Applied to Ag - Final Project - ML
Hi there!
Student 1 : Madelyn Willis
Student 2 : Charles Appolon

This repository holds the files used to complete the final project
for **CRSS 8030 - Data Science and Stats Programming Applied to Ag**, Spring Semester of 2025- Group 2  

**Goal of this project**: Train machine learning models using training data described below to predict yield on a test data (see details below).

**Background information**: We were provided with a **corn variety trial** data set.  
This data contains over **164,000 rows** spanning **10 years** (2014-2023), **45 sites** across the USA, for a total of **270** site-years, where over **5,000** corn hybrids were evaluated.  

We were provided with the following **training data** for years 2014-2023:   

  - Trait information (including site, year, hybrid, yield, and grain moisture)  
  - Meta information (including site, year, previous crop, longitude, and latitude)  
  - Soil information (including site, year, soil pH, soil organic matter, soil P, soil K)  

We were provided with the following **testing data** for year 2024:  
  - Submission information (site, year, hybrid, **no yield**)  
  - Meta information (same as training)  
  - Soil information (same as training)
